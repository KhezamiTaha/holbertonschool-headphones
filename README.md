# 🎧 Holberton Headphones – Fully Responsive Landing Page

A clean and responsive landing page built entirely from scratch using **HTML** and **CSS**, based on a Figma design provided by Holberton School.  
📱[Live demo](https://khezamitaha.github.io/holbertonschool-headphones/).

 This project showcases my ability to translate a professional UI design into accessible, pixel-perfect code — without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or JavaScript.
